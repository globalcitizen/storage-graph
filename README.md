storage-graph
=============

Perl script that generates a visual representation of the overall
storage subsystem on a Linux system.

It would not be too hard to extend it to support other types of
unix platforms.

Note:
 * Presently not well tested on other environments
 * Full of assumptions
 * Needs loving.
